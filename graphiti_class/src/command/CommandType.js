 * EditPolicies should determine an Figures editing capabilities. 
 * It is possible to implement an Figure such that it handles all editing 
 * responsibility.<br> 
 * However, it is much more flexible and object-oriented to use 
 * EditPolicies. Using policies, you can pick and choose the editing behavior for 
 * an Figure without being bound to its class hierarchy. Code reuse is increased, 
 * and code management is easier.
